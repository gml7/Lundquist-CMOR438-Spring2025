## Concepts

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained using labeled data. That means each example in the training set comes with the correct answer. The goal is for the model to learn patterns so it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

We cover the use of supervised learning in both regression and classification, and the particular concepts/algorithms we cover are:
- Single Neuron
- Neural networks
- K-Nearest Neighbor


## The Case for Julia
The algorithms are implemented and demonstrated in Julia. Julia is a scientific computing language whose creators pose it as a more efficient but equally intuitive alternative to Python & Numpy. Julia is well-documented, functional, and occasionally even more convenient than Python, incorporating vectorized operations. With a few optimization considerations it can get close to metal. Both speed and vectorization are important for machine learning. If nothing else, I found a good excuse to learn a new language.
