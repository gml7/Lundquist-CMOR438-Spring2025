# Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on data without labeled outputs. In other words, the system tries to learn the patterns, structure, or distribution in the input data without any explicit instruction on what to predict.

Key Concepts:
- No labeled data: Unlike supervised learning, the data has no associated output labels.
- Goal: To discover hidden patterns, groupings, or representations in the data.

Common Tasks:
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points together (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN).
- Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of variables while retaining important information (e.g., PCA).
- Anomaly Detection: Identifying rare items or events which differ significantly from the majority.
- Association Rule Learning: Finding relationships between variables in large datasets.

Examples:
- Customer segmentation for marketing.
- Organizing large databases of images or documents.
- Detecting unusual behavior in network traffic.
